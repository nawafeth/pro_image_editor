## Setup

#### Web

<details>
  <summary>Show web setup</summary>

If you're displaying emoji on the web and want them to be colored by default (especially if you're not using a custom font like Noto Emoji), you can achieve this by adding the `useColorEmoji: true` parameter to your `flutter_bootstrap.js` file, as shown in the code snippet below:

```js
{{flutter_js}}
{{flutter_build_config}}

_flutter.loader.load({
    serviceWorkerSettings: {
        serviceWorkerVersion: {{flutter_service_worker_version}},
    },
    onEntrypointLoaded: function (engineInitializer) {
      engineInitializer.initializeEngine({
        useColorEmoji: true, // add this parameter
        renderer: 'canvaskit'
      }).then(function (appRunner) {
        appRunner.runApp();
      });
    }
});
```
<br/>

The HTML renderer is not supported in the image editor and has been completely removed in Flutter version >= `3.29.0`. However, if you are using an older Flutter version < `3.29`, please ensure that you enforce the canvas renderer.

To enable the Canvaskit renderer by default, you can do the following in your `flutter_bootstrap.js` file.

```js
{{flutter_js}}
{{flutter_build_config}}

_flutter.loader.load({
    serviceWorkerSettings: {
        serviceWorkerVersion: {{flutter_service_worker_version}},
    },
    onEntrypointLoaded: function (engineInitializer) {
      engineInitializer.initializeEngine({
        useColorEmoji: true,
        renderer: 'canvaskit' // add this parameter
      }).then(function (appRunner) {
        appRunner.runApp();
      });
    }
});
```

<br/>

You can view the full web example [here](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/tree/stable/example/web).

#### Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows

No additional setup required.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:pro_image_editor/pro_image_editor.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ProImageEditor.network(
    'https://picsum.photos/id/237/2000',
    callbacks: ProImageEditorCallbacks(
      onImageEditingComplete: (Uint8List bytes) async {
        /*
          Your code to process the edited image, such as uploading it to your server.

          You can choose to use await to keep the loading dialog visible until 
          your code completes, or run it without async to close the loading dialog immediately.

          By default, the image bytes are in JPG format.
        */
        Navigator.pop(context);
      },
        /* 
        Optional: If you want haptic feedback when a line is hit, similar to WhatsApp, 
        you can use the code below along with the vibration package.

          mainEditorCallbacks: MainEditorCallbacks(
            helperLines: HelperLinesCallbacks(
              onLineHit: () {
                Vibration.vibrate(duration: 3);
              }
            ),
          ),
        */
    ),
  );
}
```

#### Designs

The editor offers three prebuilt designs:
- [Grounded](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/blob/stable/example/lib/features/design_examples/grounded_example.dart)
- [Frosted-Glass](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/blob/stable/example/lib/features/design_examples/frosted_glass_example.dart)
- [WhatsApp](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/blob/stable/example/lib/features/design_examples/whatsapp_example.dart)

#### Extended-Configurations

The editor provides extensive customization options, allowing you to modify text, icons, colors, and widgets to fit your needs. It also includes numerous callbacks for full control over its functionality.

Check out the web [demo](https://hm21.github.io/pro_image_editor/) to explore all possibilities. You can find the example code for all demos [here](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/tree/stable/example/lib/features).


## Video-Editor

The video editor is an upcoming feature now included in the example folder. It is planned to support all platforms except web. The image editor already provides all required functionality, but the video processing package is still under development.

To keep the image editor as lightweight as possible, you’ll need to manually include video player package of your choice.

Currently, the editor can be extended using my `pro_video_editor` package, which supports full video generation on Android, iOS, and macOS. However, it relies on the GPL-licensed `ffmpeg` package, which may not be suitable for all companies. I’m actively exploring alternative solutions—feel free to reach out if you’re aware of a similar option with more permissive licensing.

Alternatively, as shown in the [video examples](https://github.com/hm21/pro_image_editor/tree/stable/example/lib/features/video_examples), the editor returns all the necessary information for processing videos. This allows you to integrate any package or API of your choice. For instance, you could use a cloud-based solution like [Shotstack](https://shotstack.io/) to handle video processing externally.

If you're interested in contributing to this feature, feel free to open a pull request in the [pro_video_editor](https://github.com/hm21/pro_video_editor/pulls) repository. Alternatively, sponsoring the package would enable me to dedicate more time to its development and to this functionality.
